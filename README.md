Minimal example plugin for Kodi
-------------------------------

A minimal, but working plugin for http://kodi.tv with correct directory
structure, including fanart graphics and icon.  Github "Download zip" is an
installable zip.  To make an installable zip manually, make sure the directory
in the zip file is "plugin.minimal.example-master".

This is a video addon (see addon.xml), so after installing it you can find it
in the video addons section.

The addon just displays one "directory" entry, which says Hello [username]
where username is a kodi setting.

Code is in public domain, "unlicensed". Do what you want with this code, no
credit whatsoever required and you can change the license to whatever you want.
Note though, Kodi requires a free license (GPL v2+ is suggested) for addons
included in the official repository.

Graphic files fanart.jpg and icon.png are in public domain (CC0), see

Note: Kodi used to be called XBMC, the name was changed in late 2014.
